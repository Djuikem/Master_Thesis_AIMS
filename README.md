# Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy in Healthcare
## A Comparative Study of SVMs and Deep Learning Models

This project explores how machine learning models, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Deep Learning models, can be used to improve diagnostic accuracy in healthcare. We also study hybrid methods combining the strengths of both approaches, particularly for sequential data.

## üß† Project Motivation

In healthcare, making accurate diagnoses is crucial. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), models can now assist doctors in analyzing complex data faster and more reliably. But not all models perform equally well in every situation. This study compares traditional models like SVMs and more recent deep learning techniques, identifying their strengths and limits.

## üìä Models and Methods

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**
  - Known for speed, interpretability, and performance on structured data.
- **Deep Learning Models:**
  - CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU and Transformers, adapted for image and sequential data.
- **Hybrid Approaches:**
  - The first hybrid method combines Deep Learning for feature extraction and SVM for classification.
  - The second hybrid method merges the predictions of Deep Learning and SVM model in parallel through probability averaging
  - Especially useful in medical time-series.
